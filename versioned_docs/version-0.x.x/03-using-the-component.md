# Using the component

The Paper Manager component lets the user manage the paper collection. It offers three CRUD editors. One for the paper categories, another for the authors and a third one for the papers themselves. Each can be accessed from the administration by navigating to *Components &#8594; Paper Manager &#8594; Categories*, *Components &#8594; Paper Manager &#8594; Authors* and *Components &#8594; Paper Manager &#8594; Papers* respectively. Each item in these lists has the following fields:

- Categories
  - `ID`: Record number in the database.
  - `Title`: The title of the category.
- Authors
  - `ID`: Record number in the database.
  - `Name`: The first and last name of the author.
- Papers
  - `ID`: Record number in the database.
  - `Title`: The title of the paper.
  - `Authors`: List of the paper's authors. Multiple authors can be selected. The authors can be edited in *Components &#8594; Paper Manager &#8594; Authors*.
  - `Category`: The paper's category. A single category can be selected. The categories can be edited in *Components &#8594; Paper Manager &#8594; Categories*.
  - `Year`: The year of the publication.
  - `Month`: The month of the publication.
  - `Produced In Lab`: Checkbox â€“ checked if the paper was produced in the lab. This field is relevant only on research lab or organization websites and not on personal profile websites.
  - `HTML Text`: The HTML text that will be used by the plugin to display the paper entry on the site.
