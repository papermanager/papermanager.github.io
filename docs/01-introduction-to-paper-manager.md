# What is Paper Manager?

Paper Manager is a Joomla extension allowing the management of scientific publications. The extension is useful for websites related to research laboratories and organizations. Lists of scientific papers are commonly present in such websites. A single paper can be included in more than one of these lists. For example it can be shown on a page dedicated to the conference publications of the lab and also on the profile pages of the authors. Paper Manager allows a specific paper entry to be displayed on multiple pages without copying html code on all the relative articles. The extension consists of a component and a content plugin. The component is used for CRUD operations on papers, paper categories and authors while the plugin displays lists of papers inside content (ex. articles), using special code snippets.

Paper Manager is developed for **Joomla 4.x** and any future updates will be checked for compatibility only with **4.x**.
If you need to install Paper Manager on **Joomla 3.x**, use [version 0.0.1-joomla3.x](https://github.com/papermanager/papermanager/releases/tag/v0.0.1-joomla3.x).

Please note that the extension has not been thoroughly tested and it may contain critical bugs. You can open a [new issue](https://github.com/papermanager/papermanager/issues) on GitHub or contact ![PaperManagerContactEmail](/img/christos_email.png ':no-zoom') for bug reports and feature requests.
